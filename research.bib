%How to use BibTeX. In outline:
%Create a BibTeX file of your references. (For references already typed, use this page to convert to BibTeX.) Say your file is called research.bib.
%When you want to cite an item in research.bib, write \cite{<label>} in your document, where <label> is the label of the item in research.bib. (Alternatively, you may want to use \citealt, or some other command, depending on the way you want the citation to appear.)
%In the preamble of your document, specify the citation style you want to use. For example, you might say \usepackage{natbib}.
%Somewhere in your document specify the bibliography style, by putting the command \bibliographystyle{<style>}, where <style> is the style you want to use. If you can't find a style you like, roll your own using Merlin.
%At the point you want the references to appear in your document, put \bibliography{research} (given that research.bib is the name of your BibTeX file).
%Run your document through LaTeX, then through BibTeX, then through LaTeX a couple of times.
