\chapter{Einstein Toolkit Testing}

I have a ETK demonstration account. This includes a LONI account using chaitanya.shettigara@anu.edu.au as my email address. My contact/collaborator is Frank Loeffler. My user name is ettest50, password excitedly derived from Nathaniel Merriweather. My project allocation is \verb+loni_cactus08+.

Log on to Queen Bee with
\begin{verbatim}
 ssh -XC ettest50@qb.loni.org
\end{verbatim}

Following instructions on \verb+https://docs.einsteintoolkit.org/et-docs/Tutorial_for_New_Users+

Got stuck at ``Run a Simulation" phase. Sent following query to ETK users help list:
"I cannot run a simulation using 
\verb+./simfactory/bin/sim submit static_tov --parfile=par/static_tov.par --procs=32 --walltime=8:0:0+
as per the tutorial. I get the following error:
\begin{verbatim}Parameter file: /home/ettest50/Cactus/par/static_tov.par
Error: could not access simulation base directory /scratch/ettest50/simulations for reading and writing
Aborting Simfactory\end{verbatim}

I notice that someone had the same problem back in 2011, and I created the directory by hand which seemed to be a solution that worked for him, but I keep getting the same error. I also gave it completely open access permissions in case that was the problem."
